# My Cybersecurity Projects 👩‍💻

Welcome! This repository contains my hands-on labs and projects as I document my cybersecurity journey.

## Projects

- [Security Event Analysis Labs](./security-event-analysis/README.md)
  My hands-on Blue Team journey — starting from beginner and building up to intermediate/advanced projects like threat hunting, incident response, and playbook creation.
- [Network Security Lab](./network-security-lab/README.md)  
  VLANs, ACLs, Wireshark traffic analysis, and simulated ICMP flood attacks.

(More projects coming soon...)
