# 🛡️ Security Event Analysis Labs

This folder documents my **hands-on SOC/Blue Team journey** — starting from beginner and building up to intermediate/advanced projects like threat hunting, incident response, and playbook creation.  

Each week/project includes:
- **Objective** – what I’m learning
- **Steps** – how I did it
- **Screenshots** – proof/evidence
- **Analysis** – details with it's real-world application
- **Reflection** – my takeaways
